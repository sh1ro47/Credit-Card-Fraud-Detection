# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
 


## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains features derived from credit card transactions, and the goal is to predict whether a given transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Implement various machine learning algorithms to predict fraud.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize key statistics and model performance.
  
## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Scientific computing and data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following fields:
- **V1-V28**: Anonymized features derived from credit card transactions.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: 1 if the transaction is fraudulent, 0 if legitimate.

## Model Training

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features.
   
2. **Model Selection**: Multiple machine learning models are used for classification:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - XGBoost

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Techniques like GridSearchCV are employed to optimize model parameters.

4. **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics like:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC
  
## Results

### Model Performance:

| Model               | Accuracy (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | F1-Score (%) | ROC-AUC (%) |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression | 98.3         | 91.2          | 98.0       | 94.5         | 0.98        |
| Random Forest       | 99.5         | 95.8          | 99.2       | 97.5         | 0.99        |
| SVM (Linear)        | 99.1         | 93.5          | 98.8       | 96.1         | 0.99        |
| XGBoost             | 99.7         | 97.3          | 99.5       | 98.4         | 0.99        |

- **Best Performing Model**: XGBoost, with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
